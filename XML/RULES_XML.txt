XML RULES (WELL FORMED XML):

1. XML DOCUMENTS MUST HAVE A ROOT ELEMENTS
Ex.:
<root>
	<child>
		<subchild>... </subchild>
	</child>
</root>

2. The XML Prolog is optional. If it exists, it must come first in the document.
Ex.:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

To avoid errors, you should specify the encoding used, or save your XML files as UTF-8.

3. All XML Elements must have a closing tag.
Note: The XML Prolog does not have a closing tag! This is not an error. The prolog is not a part
of the XML document.

4. XML Tags are Case Sensitive:
<Letter> is different from the tag <letter>

5. XML Elements must be properly nested.
Ex.:
<b><i>This text is bold and italic</b></i> ERROR
<b><i>This text is bold and italic</i></b> CORRECT

6. XML Attribute values must always be quoted
Ex.:
<note date="12/11/2007">
	<to>Tove</to>
	<from>Jani</from>
</note>

7. Entity References
Some characters have a special meaning in XML;
If you place a character like "<" inside an XML element, it will generate an error because
the parser interprets it as the start of a new element.
This will generate an XML error:

<message>salary < 1000</message>

To avoid this error, replace the "<" character with an entity reference:

<message>salary &lt; 1000</message>

There are 5 pre-defined entity references in XML:
&lt;	<	less than
&gt;	>	greater than
&amp;	&	ampersand
&apos;	'	apostrophe
&quot;	"	quotation mark

ONLY < AND & ARE STRICTLY ILLEGAL IN XML, BUT IT IS A GOOD HABIT TO REPLACE > WITH &gt; AS WELL.

8. Comments in XML:
Similiar to that of HTML:
<!-- this is a comment -->

Two dashes in the middle of a comment are not allowed:
<!-- this is an INVALID -- COMMENT -->

9. White-space is preserved in XML:
XML does not truncate multiple white-spaces (HTML truncates multiple white-spaces to one single white-space):

XML:						HELLO                     Tove
HTML:						HELLO Tove

10. XML Stores new line as LF
Windows applications store a new line as: carriage return and line feed (CR+LF).
Unix and Mac OS uses LF.
Old Mac systems uses CR.
XML stores a new line as LF.
