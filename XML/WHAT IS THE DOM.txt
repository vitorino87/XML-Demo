What is the DOM?

The DOM defines a standard for accessing and manipulating documents:

"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows 
programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

The HTML DOM defines a standard way for accessing and manipulating HTML documents. It presents an HTML 
document as a tree-structure.

The XML DOM defines a standard way for accessing and manipulating XML documents. It presents an XML 
document as a tree-structure.

Understanding the DOM is a must for anyone working with HTML or XML.
